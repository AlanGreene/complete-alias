# complete-alias

Programmable completion function for shell aliases.

# Intro

If you are wondering how to let the shell complete aliases automagically, then
this program is your friend.

This program provides a shell alias completion tool which:

-   Works with all commonly defined aliases, including self-aliases.

-   Uses a single function to complete all aliases.

-   Completes aliases as you type in the command line and press `<Tab>`. Nothing
    else.

See **Portability** for supported environments.

# Install & Use

1.  Install [bash-completion][bash-completion], which is a dependency of this
    program.

    You may find it already installed on your system, or, you may be able to
    install it via your system's package manager.

2.  Append the content of `completions/bash_completion.sh` into
    `~/.bash_completion`:

        cat completions/bash_completion.sh >> ~/.bash_completion

3.  Edit `~/.bash_completion` with completion functions for your own aliases.
    For example, if you want to complete alias `foo`, then add a line in its
    end:

        complete -F _complete_alias foo

4.  To complete an alias, type it and press `<Tab>`.

# Example

-   In `~/.bash_profile`:

        alias sctl='systemctl'

-   In `~/.bash_completion`:

        complete -F _complete_alias sctl

-   Type `sctl <tab>` to show `systemctl` commands:

        $ sctl <Tab>
        add-requires
        add-wants
        cancel
        cat
        condreload
        ...
